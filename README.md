# UserActivenessAnalyzer

A simple tool for analyzing user activity on Windows and Linux systems through logs, with visual insights for forensics and behavior profiling.

## Overview

**UserActivenessAnalyzer** helps you analyze user behavior by collecting and visualizing system logs. It works on both Windows and Linux, making it useful for digital forensics and user profiling. The tool focuses on terminal command usage, login times, and system activities.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS and Linux.
- **Log Parsing**: Analyzes logs like `/var/log/auth.log`, `.bash_history`, and Windows Event Viewer logs.
- **User Profiling**: Identifies patterns in login times, command usage, and session lengths.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphs and charts for easy analysis of user behavior.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: For log parsing, data analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data handling.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating charts to visualize activity.
- **Rich**: For formatted console output (optional).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set up Ubuntu on VirtualBox

1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Download the [Ubuntu 24 LTS ISO](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
3. Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox with:
   - **4GB RAM** minimum.
   - **1 processor**.
4. Install Ubuntu using the ISO file and follow the on-screen instructions.

### 2. Install Dependencies

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mantax559/user-activeness-analyzer.git
   cd user-activeness-analyzer

2. **Setup virtual environment (recommended)**
```
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Linux/macOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Installl dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt # For Linux
pip install -r requirements_macos.txt  # For macOS
pip install -r requirements_win.txt   # For Windows
```

4. **Run the tool**
Ensure proper permissions. On Windows, run your terminal or IDE as Administrator to access Event Viewer logs.
On Linux, run the script with sufficient privileges to read /var/log/auth.log and .bash_history.

5. **Run the analysis**
python main.py

6. **View results**
Visualizations are saved in data/ directory

## Usage

This tool is useful for:

* Digital Forensics: Investigate user activity and detect behavior anomalies.
* User Profiling: Understand patterns in command usage and login times.
* Education: Demonstrate system activity analysis on Windows or Linux.
